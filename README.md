## Home Service App
Developed an Android app that provides home services such as home cleaning, cooking, baby care, and cloth washing using Kotlin and Firebase. The app consists of two parts: a user app and an admin app. The user app allows users to easily book and manage home services. The admin app allows administrators to manage maids, bookings, and payments.

The app uses Firebase for database, login/signup authentication, and FCM messaging notifications.

In my Home Service Android application, I embarked on a mission to provide convenient and reliable home services, encompassing an array of essential tasks such as home cleaning, cooking, baby care, and cloth washing. This project not only streamlined domestic chores but also incorporated a robust technology stack.
