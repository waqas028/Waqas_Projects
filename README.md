## Home Service App
Developed an Android app that provides home services such as home cleaning, cooking, baby care, and cloth washing using Kotlin and Firebase. The app consists of two parts: a user app and an admin app. The user app allows users to easily book and manage home services. The admin app allows administrators to manage maids, bookings, and payments.

The app uses Firebase for database, login/signup authentication, and FCM messaging notifications.

In my Home Service Android application, I embarked on a mission to provide convenient and reliable home services, encompassing an array of essential tasks such as home cleaning, cooking, baby care, and cloth washing. This project not only streamlined domestic chores but also incorporated a robust technology stack.

Key highlights of this venture included leveraging Firebase for a secure and efficient database, seamlessly integrating Firebase Authentication for user sign-up and login, and harnessing the power of Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for real-time message notifications. The result is a user-friendly and indispensable tool that enhances the quality of daily life by simplifying the procurement of home services through the seamless fusion of technology and convenience.
